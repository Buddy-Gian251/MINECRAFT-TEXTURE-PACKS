# MINECRAFT-TEXTURE-PACKS
This is a repository full of `.zip` files

## How do I use these texture packs?
You simply need a server host for Minecraft (Java or Bedrock, depends) and then try pasting the raw link, an example is `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/main/pack.zip`, but if your prefered choice isn't here, I'm sorry but try to find another one of the texture pack hosts instead.
